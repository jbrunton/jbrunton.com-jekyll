<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
<p>I work as a full-stack web and systems engineer across a variety of
    technologies, including RoR, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">something called TcL</a>.
    My background includes .NET/WPF applications development with
    Prism, and I have experience with a number of functional languages
    (including Haskell and OCaml), which is reflected in the way I
    solve programming problems.</p>

<p>Some presentations I've given on designing large-scale client-side applications:</p>
