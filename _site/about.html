                    <h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a professional software engineer, with interests in art, politics, international relations.  I'm also an advocate for the separation of church and state.</p>

<p>This site links to some of the things I do and some of the things I write.  Please feel free to respond, complain or ignore as you like.</p>

            <p>I work as a full-stack web and systems engineer across a variety of technologies (including JavaScript/CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">something called TcL</a>).
            <p>My background includes .NET/WPF application development with Prism, and I have experience with a number of functional languages (including Haskell and OCaml).  One of the subjects I therefore find interesting is how, with modern languages, the best practices from these different technology stacks and paradigms can be combined to create a best of all worlds.
            <p>I'm also interested in the theory of software design, and I'm always striving to find ways to make it intuitive and to easily put it into practice.  As such, a lot of content on this site will endeavor to distil the theory down to easily applicable principles.
