        <p>The benefits of well designed code are clear: good code is that which is readable, maintainable and testable.  And code with such qualities has very real benefits for a business: it's cheaper to develop, safer to change, and easier to hire and on-board new engineers.
        
        <p>I'm interested in the theory of software design, but I'm always thoroughly concerned with the practical: how can abstract notions, such as complexity, be made intuitive easily put it into practice.  As such, a lot of the posts on this site endeavor to distil the theory down to pragmatic rules-of-thumb to help one easily identify good coding practices from those which will be costly.
        
        <h2>Dependency Injection</h2>
        
        <p>I'm particularly interested in the application of dependency injection in order to achieve highly testable and platform-independent code.  I've been experimenting with how best to combine proven design patterns for structuring JavaScript code with DI, and also a Rails-like DSL.  The project is available on github:
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jbrunton/frappuccino-core">frappuccino-core</a> is the core framework gem, including a DI container, DSL for structuring domain models, and patterns for writing loosely coupled, modular applications.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jbrunton/frappuccino-demo">frappuccino-demo</a> is a demo application, with a readme which highlights some of the most notable features of the framework.  Take a look here for an introduction.
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        
        <p>Here are some slides from presentations I've given on the subject of designing large-scale client-side applications:
        
        <ul>

            <p>I work as a full-stack web and systems engineer across a variety of technologies (including JavaScript/CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">something called TcL</a>).
            <p>My background includes .NET/WPF application development with Prism, and I have experience with a number of functional languages (including Haskell and OCaml).  One of the subjects I therefore find interesting is how, with modern languages, the best practices from these different technology stacks and paradigms can be combined to create a best of all worlds.
            <p>I'm also interested in the theory of software design, and I'm always striving to find ways to make it intuitive and to easily put it into practice.  As such, a lot of content on this site will endeavor to distil the theory down to easily applicable principles.
