        </p>

        <p>Following on from my post <a href="/blog/2012/10/10/how-to-write-testable-code">How To Write Testable Code</a>, these are the three most important rules I always try to follow when writing unit tests, to really get the most value from them.</p>

<p>There are other, more subtle principles worth learning about (Steven Sanderson has a <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2009/08/24/writing-great-unit-tests-best-and-worst-practises/">great post here</a> which explores the importance of orthogonality, as well as highlighting many of the points that I reiterate below) &mdash; but for the most part, if I adhere to these principles, then I find the rest follow naturally.</p>

<h2>1. Test each subject in isolation</h2>

<p>Well designed units of code can and should be tested in isolation.  Any dependencies should be replaced with appropriate <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">test doubles</a>, in order that your tests assert nothing about the behavior of other units of code.  Otherwise, your tests will be unnecessarily brittle, with dependencies on large amounts of code beyond the subject under test (SUT) &mdash; and failures elsewhere in the codebase will cause cascading failures across your unit tests, making it hard to determine the source of each error.</p>

<h2>2. Write atomic tests</h2>

<p>A single test which tries to assert everything it can about the SUT isn't very useful &mdash; because if one test fails it can have a domino effect on the assertions which follow it, making it hard to infer anything meaningful from the remainder of the test cases.  More problematic than that, though, is that without being extremely careful to manually tear down and setup all relevant variables and objects between each assertion, it can be difficult to be sure that all passing tests are valid, because, as the state of the test subject changes through the course of the test, it's hard to be sure that the setup steps correctly return it to the "initial" state expected by each assertion.</p>

<h2>3. Test behaviors (not implementation details)</h2>

<p>Suppose I'm implementing a collection of some kind:</p>

<pre><code>class UsersCollection
    constructor: -&gt;
        @_users = []

    add: (user) =&gt;
        @_users.push(user)

    remove: (user) =&gt;
        @_users = _.without(@_users, user)

    get: (id) =&gt;
        _.find @_users,
            (user) -&gt; user.id == id
</code></pre>

<p>You might want to start by testing that the add method works as expected.  Here's one possible implementation:</p>

<pre><code>beforeEach -&gt;
    collection = new UsersCollection

describe "#add", -&gt;

    it "should add an element to the collection", -&gt;
        user = new User( name: "Joe" )
        collection.add(user)
        expect(collection._users).toEqual([user])
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that it tightly couples the test to the implementation of our collection.  We might later decide to use a hashmap internally, for example &mdash; but then the test will fail, because we no longer have a list called <code>_users</code>.</p>

<p>A better implementation will test for the expected <em>behavior</em> of the collection &mdash; e.g. that the element can now be retrieved through the classes interface as expected.</p>

<pre><code>describe "#add", -&gt;
    it "should add an element to the collection", -&gt;
        user = new User( id: 1, name: "Joe" )
        collection.add(user)
        expect(collection.get(1)).toBe(user)
</code></pre>

<p>With this approach, you can refactor your implementation as you like, safe in the knowledge that your tests will continue to pass or fail according to the intended behavior of the class.</p>

            <p>I work as a full-stack web and systems engineer across a variety of technologies (including JavaScript/CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">something called TcL</a>).
            <p>My background includes .NET/WPF application development with Prism, and I have experience with a number of functional languages (including Haskell and OCaml).  One of the subjects I therefore find interesting is how, with modern languages, the best practices from these different technology stacks and paradigms can be combined to create a <a class="link" href="/blog/2012/10/21/introducing-frappuccino">best of all worlds</a>.
            <p>I'm also interested in the theory of software design, and I'm always striving to find ways to make it intuitive and to easily put it into practice.  As such, a lot of content on this site will endeavor to distil the theory down to easily applicable principles.
