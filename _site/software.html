                    <h1>Software</h1>

<p>I work as a full-stack web and systems engineer across a variety of technologies, including RoR, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">something called TcL</a>.</p>

<p>My background includes .NET/WPF application development with Prism, and I have experience with a number of functional languages (including Haskell and OCaml), which is reflected in the way I solve programming problems.</p>

<p>Over the years I've also worked extensively with Java, Delphi/Object Pascal and C++, but I'm less excited by those today.</p>

<h2>Software Design</h2>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the application of dependency injection in order to achieve highly testable and platform-independent code.  I've been experimenting with how best to combine proven design patterns for structuring JavaScript code with DI, and also a Rails-like DSL.  The project is available on github:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jbrunton/frappuccino-core">frappuccino-core</a> is the core framework gem, including a DI container, DSL for structuring domain models, and patterns for writing loosely coupled, modular applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jbrunton/frappuccino-demo">frappuccino-demo</a> is a demo application, with a readme which highlights some of the most notable features of the framework.  Take a look here for an introduction.</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, here are some slides from presentations I've given on the subject of designing large-scale client-side applications:</p>
